- static analysis
  - binding / resolution: for each identifier, we find out where that name is defined and wire the two together
    - this is where scope comes into play
- lexical (lexicographic) errors
  - it happends when the interpreter doesn't understand the characters to transform into a token
  - when getting an error, it doesn't need to stop. We keep scanning the source code.
    - we should get all possible errors in one go
